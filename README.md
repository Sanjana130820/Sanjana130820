### 👩‍💻 About Me

I’m **Sai Naga Sanjana Chippada**, a passionate **AI/ML enthusiast** and driven data professional with a strong foundation across the data lifecycle — from engineering robust pipelines to deriving insights and building intelligent systems.

Currently pursuing my **Master’s in Data Analytics at San José State University**, I bring hands-on experience in **Data Engineering, Data Analysis, and Machine Learning**. I’ve previously worked as a **Senior Analyst at Capgemini**, where I built scalable data workflows and analytics dashboards that drove business impact.

My areas of expertise span:

- **Data Engineering**: Designing ETL pipelines, orchestrating workflows with Airflow, managing cloud data with **GCP** and **AWS**, and ensuring scalable, clean data for downstream use.
- **Data Analysis & Business Intelligence**: Leveraging **SQL**, **Python**, and tools like **Tableau**, **Looker**, and **Power BI** to uncover trends and deliver actionable insights.
- **Machine Learning & AI**: Developing predictive models, fine-tuning LLMs, and exploring the cutting edge of **Generative AI**, **LangChain**, and **OpenAI APIs** to solve real-world problems.
- **Full-Stack Data Projects**: From raw data ingestion to final model deployment, I enjoy building end-to-end systems that merge engineering precision with AI innovation.

🔍 I am continuously exploring advancements in **Deep Learning**, **Large Language Models**, and **Agentic RAG** systems — always curious about how to blend **intelligence**, **automation**, and **scalability** in data products.

🎯 My goal is to contribute to impactful projects, collaborate with visionary teams, and build solutions that make data not just useful, but transformational.
